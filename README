# Task 5 - Decision Trees and Random Forests

This repo contains code and artifacts for Task 5: training Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.

## Files
- notebook.ipynb or script.py - main code (Decision tree, Random forest, cross-validation, visualizations)
- artifacts/
  - best_decision_tree.joblib
  - random_forest.joblib
  - feature_importances.csv
  - report.txt

## How to run
1. Upload `heart.csv` (or your dataset) to the working directory, or adjust `csv_filename` variable.
2. Run the notebook in Google Colab.
3. Inspect `artifacts` for saved models and results.

## Notes
- If you don't have a CSV, the script uses sklearn's breast cancer dataset as a fallback.
- Visualizations use matplotlib and seaborn.
